# Step Index Prediction using Advances in Financial Machine Learning

## Overview

This project applies techniques from Advances in Financial Machine Learning by Marcos LÃ³pez de Prado to build a predictive Machine Learning model for the Step Index asset on Deriv. The approach leverages state-of-the-art methodologies in financial machine learning to enhance predictive accuracy and robustness.

## Features

* Financial Data Preprocessing: Implements advanced data preprocessing techniques tailored for high-frequency trading data.

* Fractional Differentiation: Applies the fractional differentiation technique to retain memory in time series while ensuring stationarity.

* Feature Engineering: Extracts meaningful features from tick data, including volatility-based labels.

* Machine Learning Model: In progress..

* Performance Evaluation: In progress..

## Dataset

The dataset consists of tick-level data for the Step Index asset on Deriv, including:

* Bid and Ask Prices

* Timestamps (Datetime)

* Derived Features (e.g., volatility-based labels, rolling statistics, etc.)

## Files

_The Advances_Financial_ML.ipynb_: Contains all the implementation and a good documentation.
